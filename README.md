# AppLauncher - runtime configurable, Office365-style application launcher (splash screen).

Builds one, small, .Net Framework dependent executable file with one config.xml file.

## To get started
- Build this solution,
- set up config.xml to your needs,
- place both files on the network drive,
- create shortcut on your colleagues desktops.

Because launcher files are very small it starts off very fast off network drive.

When you want to update your actual application build it, zip it, copy to network drive and update config.xml. Launcher ensures users of your application will get latest version before it will be opened.
